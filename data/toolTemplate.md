# {Name of the Tool}

[5 minute] This tutorial covers MyDomains, a PROSITE/ExPASy tool used to generate
schematic diagrams of protein domain architecture. The tool works by allowing users
to input a protein’s length and the positions of its domains or motifs, then
automatically producing a visual map of those features. In virus discovery,
such diagrams help researchers quickly interpret predicted viral proteins,
compare domain arrangements, and identify hallmark domains that support classification
or functional inference.

**Tutorial Objective**: By the end of this tutorial, you will know how to use the 
MyDomains web interface to input a protein sequence, define its domains, and 
generate a clear visual map of its domain architecture.

## Input / Prerequisites
- Any Web Browser
- https://prosite.expasy.org/cgi-bin/prosite/mydomains/
- Sample details for the protein being analyzed

## Output

The output is a graphic image (in PNG format) showing a schematic of the protein: 
a rectangular “bar” representing the full protein, with colored/shaped boxes 
(or shapes) along it corresponding to the domains (or other features) you specified.
